## Animation

Did you know you can use CSS to make things move around? You'll learn how on this card!

+ Before you get started, make sure you have a picture on your website with an `id` and a corresponding CSS block which sets the `width` to `100px`. I'm going with the picture of the barn owl from before, and my CSS block looks like this:

```css
    #owly {
        border-radius: 100%;
        width: 100px;
    }
```

+ Go to the bottom of your CSS file and add the following code:

```css
    @keyframes myFirstAnimation {
        from {
            width: 100px;
        }
        to {
            width: 300px;
        }
    }
```

This code creates an animation called `myFirstAnimation` that you can add to any element on your website. What do you think it will do?

+ Find your CSS rules for the picture and add the following three properties:

```css
    animation-name: myFirstAnimation;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-iteration-count: 1;
```

+ Now watch what happens on your web page! Try different values for `animation-iteration-count` to see what it does.

+ Let's try another animation! Add the following code to the end of your CSS file:

```css
    @keyframes rainbowGlow {
        0% {
            color: #FFD700;
        }
        50% {
            color: #663399;
        }
        100% {
            color: #FFD700;
        }
    }
```
   
+ Now find the `#myCoolText` CSS rules from earlier and add in the animation code:

```css
    #myCoolText {        
        color: #003366;
        border: 2px ridge #ccffff;
        padding: 15px;
        text-align: center;
        animation-name: rainbowGlow;
        animation-duration: 1.5s;
        animation-iteration-count: 1;
    }
```

When you use **percentage values** instead of `from` and `to`, you're able to set in-between values as well as just start and end values. You can set as many in-between values as you like using different percentage values from `0` all the way up to `100`. 

+ Change the value of `animation-iteration-count` to `infinite`. See if you can guess what will happen before you test it!

+ Try out different values for `animation-duration` to speed up or slow down your animation.

+ One final trick! Add this animation code:

```css
    @keyframes slide {
        0% {
            background-position-x: 0;
        }
        100% {
            background-position-x: 600vw;
        }
    }
```

+ Now find the `#frontPage` CSS rules you wrote earlier and change them to:

```css
    #frontPage {
        background: repeating-linear-gradient(-45deg, red 0%, yellow 7.14%, lime 14.28%, cyan 21.42%, cyan 28.56%, blue 35.7%, magenta 42.84%, red 50%);
        background-size: 600vw 600vw;
        animation: slide 10s infinite linear forwards;
    }
```

Don't worry about understanding all of the code above... just sit back and enjoy!!
